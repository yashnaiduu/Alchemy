## 🍸 About The Project

**Alchemy** is a premium cocktail discovery application designed for the modern mixologist. It bridges the gap between your home inventory and professional bartending.

Unlike standard recipe apps, Alchemy focuses on **"What can I make right now?"** by intelligently matching your available ingredients against a curated database of 100+ classic and modern cocktails.

Wrapped in a stunning **glassmorphism UI**, it offers a visually immersive experience that feels as premium as the drinks you create.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Smart Discovery** - Instantly browse 109+ curated, verified recipes.
- **🎒 Pantry Matcher** - Input your home inventory to find compatible cocktails.
- **🎨 Glassmorphism UI** - distinct, beautiful aesthetic with backdrop blurs and smooth gradients.
- **📱 Fully Responsive** - Optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **🌙 Dark Mode** - Easier on the eyes for those late-night mixing sessions.
- **💾 Favorites System** - Save your go-to drinks for quick access.
